  Throughout this design thinking project, I have learned more about the process of creating a new app, starting from identifying the problems
  to testing the app. This project has given me a chance to know what it would be like if I were to create a new application. It is definitely not easy to complete this by myself. 
  Thus, I am very grateful to my group members for their cooperation throughout the entire project by giving different points of view for every part of the project.
  It was a great experience because I learned different skills, such as communication skills and video editing skills while working on this project.
  After the presentation, we received feedback from our lecturer, Dr. Azurah and we learned that we could improve our app by using a question bot instead of the FAQs page to 
  make our app better and more user-friendly.
