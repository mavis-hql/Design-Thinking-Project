Throughout this design thinking project, I have learned more about the process to create a new app starting from identifying the problems 
to testing the app. It was a great experience because I learned different skills such as communication skills and also video editing skills.
After the presentation, we learned that we could improve our app by using a question bot instead of using the FAQs page to 
make our app better and more user-friendly.
